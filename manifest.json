//"run_at" tells when to load the javascript,
//"matches" tells the URL to match to inject the code which I'm using Gmail here,
//"js" tells all .js files to inject,
//"CSS" tells about all included CSS files for injection.

//web_accessible_resources specify the path and format of files which the web page require to load from extension.
//But why? because webpage and extension executes in isolated environments.They can't access one another's resources directly.
//and in the following way we allow web page to access the required files from extension.
